      I’ve spent the last 10+ years working in Learning & Development, building leadership programs and learning content people actually want to use. I stay curious about new learning approaches and tech, and I focus on creating content that’s easy to consume and built with the learner in mind. I care about clear outcomes, measurable results, and positive learning experiences. I usually start by asking, “If I needed to learn this, where would I begin?” and build from there—adding the resources people need to be successful.

      Here are a few things I’ve built or worked on—some digital, some hands-on. Each project is designed with the same focus I bring to learning experiences: clarity, engagement, and real outcomes.

        A quick, interactive tool I built to make learning and referencing company policies simple and easy to use. Think of it as “learning at your fingertips.”
